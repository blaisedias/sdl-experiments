# piCorePlayer
Scripts in direcrtory pcp support building on piCorePlayer
* download-sdl2.sh : Downloads the packages (tczs) required to build on piCorePlayer
  * packages are only dowloaded but not loaded into memory and are not usable.
  * typically required just once or when updated
* load-sdl2-dev.sh : Loads the packages required to build on piCorePlayer into memory
  * usable after download-sdl2.sh has been invoked at least once
  * this is a subset of the packages loaded by load-sdl2-dev.sh
* load-sdl2-run.sh : Loads the packages required to run on piCorePLayer into memory
  * usable after download-sdl2.sh has been invoked at least once
  * this is a subset of the packages loaded by load-sdl2-dev.sh
  * this set of packages is insufficient to build the executables
